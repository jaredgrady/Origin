/**
 * Room games
 * Pokemon Showdown - http://pokemonshowdown.com/
 *
 * Room games are an abstract representation of an activity that a room
 * can be focused on, such as a battle, tournament, or chat game like
 * Hangman. Rooms are limited to one roomgame at a time.
 *
 * Room games can keep track of designated players. If a user is a player,
 * they will not be allowed to change name until their games are complete.
 *
 * The player system is optional: Some games, like Hangman, don't designate
 * players and just allow any user in the room to play.

	// Commands:

	// These are all optional to implement:

	// forfeit(user)
	//   Called when a user uses /forfeit
	//   Also planned to be used for some force-forfeit situations, such
	//   as when a user changes their name and .allowRenames === false
	//   This is strongly recommended to be supported, as the user is
	//   extremely unlikely to keep playing after this function is
	//   called.

	// choose(user, text)
	//   Called when a user uses /choose [text]
	//   If you have buttons, you are recommended to use this interface
	//   instead of making your own commands.

	// undo(user, text)
	//   Called when a user uses /undo [text]

	// joinGame(user, text)
	//   Called when a user uses /joingame [text]

	// leaveGame(user, text)
	//   Called when a user uses /leavegame [text]

	// Events:

	// Note:
	// A user can have multiple connections. For instance, if you have
	// two tabs open and connected to PS, those tabs represent two
	// connections, but a single PS user. Each tab can be in separate
	// rooms.

	// onJoin(user)
	//   Called when a user joins a room. (i.e. when the user's first
	//   connection joins)

	// onRename(user, oldUserid, isJoining)
	//   Called when a user in the game is renamed. `isJoining` is true
	//   if the user was previously a guest, but now has a username.
	//   Check `!user.named` for the case where a user previously had a
	//   username but is now a guest.

	// onLeave(user)
	//   Called when a user leaves the room. (i.e. when the user's last
	//   connection leaves)

	// onConnect(user, connection)
	//   Called each time a connection joins a room (after onJoin if
	//   applicable).

	// onUpdateConnection(user, connection)
	//   Called for each connection in a room that changes users by
	//   merging into a different user. By default, runs the onConnect
	//   handler.

	// Player updates and an up-to-date report of what's going on in
	// the game should be sent during `onConnect`. You should rarely
	// need to handle the other events.

	onRename(user, oldUserid) {
		if (!this.allowRenames) return;
		if (!(oldUserid in this.players)) return;
		if (user.userid === oldUserid) {
			this.players[user.userid].name = user.name;
