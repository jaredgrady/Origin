- Movepool: Ice Punch, Seed Bomb, Recover
- Notes: Well it seems like a thick beard really is the best defense and offense!  Good set up sweeper as well as an effective revenge killer. Very good at cleaning late game when bulkier walls that checking are gone.

- Ability: Magic Immunity - Immune to all status and indirect damage, +2.5 Attack on entry
- Move: Float's Sharingans - Protect + copies all positive stat boosts and volatiles (substitute, leech seed, aqua ring, etc). PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 3

- Move: Furry Cosplay, switches forms between Pikachu and Fennekin and will replace moves accordingly.  Boosts speed and special attack by 1 stage, but will not boost them higher than +1.  Has a 15% chance of failing and KO'ing itself.  Changes weather accordingly for the form.
- Movepool: Thunder/Searing Shot, Steam Eruption/SolarBeam, Hurricane/Earth Power
- Notes: Priority, Neo Soul, CGTNathan and Erica hurts it a lot.  Watch out for it's ability to form change and turn a losing type matchup into a favourable matchup.

&Erica07 - Meloetta - Leftovers
- Ability: Mischievous - Prankster + Ignores substitutes and type effectiveness.
- Move: Admonish - Uses haze, worry seed, and noble roar on the opponent. PP: 5 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 1
- Movepool: Rest, Sleep Talk, Shadow Ball
- Notes: Remove boosts from the opponent in hopes of saving your team from getting swept. If the opponent doesn't have a reliable way to deal a lot of damage to it, it can really turn games around.

- Ability: Dragon's Fire - Multiscale + Tough Claws + Moxie
- Move: Dragon Strike - Physical, 120BP, 1/3 recoil, Dragon Type, 50% of getting a defense boost. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 1
- Movepool: Dragon Dance, Belly Drum, Fire Punch, Flare Blitz, Shadow Claw, Double-Edge, Roost
- Notes: A frightening revenge killer that is capable of sweeping as well, be afraid if you see the Dragon dance + Roost set. The recoil can prevent it from sweeping as effectively, but still very dangerous.

&Sky Might Fall - Gyarados-Mega - Gyaradosite
- Ability: Cursed Aura - Opponent takes 15% on entry and exit of this Pokémon
- Move: Silent Departure - 100 BP Dark type U-turn. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Sucker Punch, Night Slash, Crabhammer, Pursuit, Focus Energy, Dragon Dance

- Movepool: Earthquake, Brave Bird, Head Smash, Earthquake, Iron Head, Roost
- Notes: Don't bother trying to find something to switch into this, because you won't.  It leaves no survivors in it's path with it's extremely powerful attacks, and is one of the best wallbreakers in this meta. Once your checks are gone, it will tear so many holes in your team.

@Nii Sama - Darkrai - Life Orb

- Move: Shadow Drain - 60BP Dark type special draining move. Power is doubled if target is asleep. PP: 15 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0

- Movepool: Knock Off, Swords Dance, Earthquake, Roost
- Notes: Physically Bulky as an Gliscor, with a neat boost to Special Defense. Can also boost and sweep lategame, against slower threats, and has the neat Flying STAB that Gliscor usually lack.

%CreaturePhil - Rotom-W - Sitrus Berry
- Ability: feelsgd - Levitate + Soundproof + Harvest
- Move: Water Bomb - 120BP, special water type move, 1000% burn chance, now who said scald was bad! PP: 5 / Accuracy: 90% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Volt Switch, Will-o-wisp, Pain Split
- Notes: Good check to some of the metagame's scary physical attackers and water types, and the burn chance is quite amazing together with the accuracy. Harvest Sitrus Berry keeps it alive for more time than you'll want it to.

- Move: Time 2 Die - 120 BP Physical Fire type move, 60% chance to burn. Thaws user. PP: 20 / Accuracy: 90% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, Brave Bird, Wood Hammer
- Notes: If you think it's not time to die, then you're wrong. There are little things that can take hits from this, with its Sun Boosted STAB Move tearing holes through teams. Ho-Oh's usually crippling weakness to Rocks and Water Moves is fixed by its Ability, making it even harder to combat. However, it's quite slow compared to most of the dangerous sweepers running wild in OSSB, and doesn't have a lot of Physical bulk, so it can be quite easily taken down by strong physical sweepers. However, it is still a very dangerous threat you don't want to face.

%iSandman - Landorus-Incarnate - Life Orb
- Ability: God's Force - Sheer Force
- Move: Mega Earth Fissure - 110 BP special, ground type attack, with secondary effects, hits non grounded pokemon for 1.5x damage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0

- Movepool: Toxic, Brave Bird, Roost
- Notes: Extremely hard to take down with physical attackers, use this to your advantage and sweep with a recoilless Brave Bird! However, don't forget to use Nidificate, or it will be very weak.

%Selena - Samurott (Water/Ice) - Leftovers
- Ability: Wings of Reason - All moves heal 50% of damage dealt + Sturdy that always activates at 20% health or less + attack, defense, special defense, and speed are boosted by 1 stage on entry.

- Movepool: Sacred Sword, Razor Shell, Swords Dance
- Notes: A very good draining sweeper. If their HP drops below 20%, you can't KO them, meaning they get a free turn to attack. and consequentially, heal. Make sure you hit with a powerful attack, or have boosts, because if you don't KO, you're going to regret it.

- Movepool: Weather Ball, Earth Power, [Hurricane, Thunder, Energy Ball, Solar Beam - depending on weather]
- Notes: One of the few pokemon that can summon weather, but can be unpredictable at times, if lucky you can do some major damage with it.

+Chronologically - Victini (Fire/Fighting type) - Balloon
- Ability: Victory Prankster - Their non-damaging moves have their priority increased by 1
- Move: Power Up Meme - 70BP Physical Fighting move, 100% to raise the attack by 1 stage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0 (Boosted by ability)
- Movepool: Sacred Fire, Teeter Dance, Drain Punch
- Notes: It hits many pokemon extremely hard, just watch out for water types.

+Crystal Gray - Greninja - Expert Belt
- Ability: Speedy Gonzales - Protean + Speed Boost
- Move: Hydro Smash - 120 BP Special Water Move, 10% to Paralyze or Flinch, raises defense and special defense by 1 stage, lowers speed by 1 stage. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 90% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Ice Beam, Extrasensory, Dark Pulse
- Notes: Despite having no reliable recovery, if this pokemon gets too many boosts, few Pokmeon can stop it, from hitting hard and fast. Great, full STAB coverage makes it hard to take hits from this Pokemon.

+Jigglykong - Porygon2 - Eviolite
- Ability: 3bawlky5u - Regenerator + Unaware + Insomnia
- Move: Plasma Blast - 140 BP Special Normal/Electric Move, 25% chance to burn target. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, Toxic, Heal Bell
- Notes: Bulky threat that can stall out opponents quite easily. Regenerator and Recover ensure it keeps healthy enough to wall things, Toxic is useful for stalling opponents out, and Heal Bell keeps it durable. it's also very good versus setup sweepers and walls as it ignores all their boosts. Its STAB 140 BP move hits everything quite hard, and has a good chance to burn, which cripples Physical attackers a lot. It can lose to things unaffected by Status that can wall it better than it can wall them, or take it out with powerful hits. Still a huge threat to watch out for.

+Master Bui - Buizel - Eviolite
- Ability: Ocean's Grace - Serene Grace + Primordial Sea + Parental Bond
- Move: Dance of the Sea - 100BP, +1 priority, Special Water type move. 50% confusion and 50% chance to boost defense and special defense by one stage. 10PP, 100% Accuracy
- Movepool: Charge Beam, Earth Power, Ice Beam
- Notes: While it does not initially hit hard, it gets extremely bulky really quickly, potential counters include sparkychild, Tesla, Imp Fallen Blood, Erica, and anything with Unaware-type abilities.  Master Bui also does not fare well against status, so use that to your advantage. Bui~!

+Otami - Espeon (Psychic/Fairy type)- Leftovers
- Ability: Telekinetic - Magic Bounce + Magic Guard + Rattled
- Move: Telekinetic Chant - 90 BP Special Psychic type move. 40% of putting target to sleep, 20% chance to boost special attack and special defense by 2 stages. PP: 20 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0

- Movepool: Belly Drum, Pursuit, Drain Punch
- Notes: The bulk is real.  If you give Munchlax a free chance to use belly drum, say goodbye to your team...Belly.

Hat Blaze - Blaziken - Life Orb
- Ability: Blaze Power - Study + Guts + Magic Guard + Poisons itself on Entry

- Movepool: High Jump Kick, Flare Blitz, Roost, Brave Bird, Needle Arm, Zen Headbutt, Sleep Talk, Poison Jab, Feint, Mimic
- Notes: Very powerful threat with good coverage, decent bulk and amazing speed after boosts, and 2 powerful STAB moves with few drawbacks. Sturdy gives it a useful way to guarantee it survives, and can be useful when killing threats. It has a hard time dealing with threats with Unaware and bulky threats. It can destroy unprepared opponents with ease.

Imp Fallen Blood - Sceptile-Mega (Grass/Flying) - Sceptilite
- Ability: Pirate - Trace + Gastro Acid
- Move: Jet Gattling - 120 BP special Grass type move, 60% of lowering special defense by 2 stages. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Aeroblast, Aura Sphere, Earth Power
- Notes: A unique pokemon in this format, acting as a check to many water types, and a good wallbreaker if used right. Can really take advantage of a lot of pokemon in the tier by taking their abilities away, and using it itself.

Mr. CGTNathan - Cofagrigus - Leftovers
- Ability: Graveyard - Trick room is active when this Pokémon is on the field, completely reverses priority.
- Move: Graveyard Strike - 80BP Hex that will burn the opponent before the damage is dealth. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, Destiny Bond, Heal Bell
- Notes: This Pokémon affect the metagame a lot by turning many physical attacker's speed and attack back on them with a "super fast" Graveyard Strike.  I hope you have a burn heal ready...

Nineage - Arceus - Life Orb
- Ability: error - Uses Defog on Entry
- Move: Break Code - Randomly scatters entry hazards on both sides, sets random weather, sets random status on itself, and then faints. PP: 5 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 8
- Movepool: Extreme Speed, Metronome, Present
- Notes: Hazards, especially Stealth Rock and Toxic Spikes, are a thorn in the side for most fire types and set up sweepers.  While it does cause the user trouble, the opponent is also put under pressure.  Use this move with caution, when only a major part of your team is unaffected by the hazards, or when you truly need their support to counter the opponent's sweepers. STAB Life Orb Extreme Speed can be used to revenge kill threats at low health.

Omega Chime - Chimecho - Life Orb
- Ability: Wave Guard - Magic Guard + Unaware. Raises Speed, Defense, Special Attack and Special Defense by one stage upon entry.
- Move: Audioshock - 80 BP Fairy Type Move. Sound Move. 60% chance to raise Special Attack by one Stage. PP: 15 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
- Movepool: Recover, Psystrike, Earthpower
- Notes: Good revenge killer, and very good setup sweeper, with a dangerous offensive typing, good movepool that hit almost every type combination and two very helpful abilities, making it a very difficult threat to switch into. The high chance to raise Special Attack can prove deadly if you have no checks. However, it's quite frail even with defense boosts, and the speed isn't the best compared to some of the strongest sweepers in the tier. It will tear down your team while being cuter than you!

Omega Nivans - Octillery - Expert Belt
- Ability: Machinegunner - Technician + Skill Link, all single hit moves hit 5 times, +2 defense and special defense on entry
- Move: Anti-Material Rifle - Special, Attacks 6 times in a row, 30 BP, each attack of a different random type. PP: 10 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0

- Notes: Try your luck with Nivans; he's full of surprises that can make the opponent suffer! Due to its huge movepool full of Set Up moves, and a 5 Hit, very powerful Priority move, it's incredibly hard to wall and deal with.

Origin Server - Mew - Leftovers
- Ability: Uses TopsyTurvy against opponent on entry
- Move: Tri Spikes - Puts up 3 layers of spikes. PP: 20 / Accuracy: 100% / Priority: 0
